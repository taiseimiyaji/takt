# Research Piece
# A piece that autonomously executes research tasks
# Planner creates the plan, Digger executes, Supervisor verifies
#
# Flow:
# plan -> dig -> supervise -> COMPLETE (approved)
#                          -> plan (rejected: restart from planning)
#
# Template Variables:
#   {iteration}      - Piece-wide turn count (total movements executed across all agents)
#   {max_iterations} - Maximum iterations allowed for the piece
#   {movement_iteration} - Per-movement iteration count (how many times THIS movement has been executed)
#   {task}           - Original user request
#   {previous_response} - Output from the previous movement
#   {user_inputs}    - Accumulated user inputs during piece
#   {report_dir}     - Report directory name (e.g., "20250126-143052-task-summary")

      - Movement Iteration: {movement_iteration} (times this movement has run)
      - Movement: plan

      ## Research Request

      ## Additional User Inputs
      {user_inputs}

      ## Instructions
      Create a research plan for the above request.

      **Important**: Do not ask the user questions.
      - Make assumptions for unclear points and proceed
      - If multiple interpretations exist, include all in the research scope
      - If there is feedback from Supervisor, incorporate it into the plan

      Execute the research according to the plan above.

      - Research within the scope of what can be investigated
      - Report items that could not be researched as "Unable to research"

      ## Original Research Request
      {task}

      ## Digger's Research Results
      {previous_response}

      ## Instructions
      Evaluate the research results and determine if they adequately answer the original request.

      **Important**: If there are issues, include specific instructions for the Planner.
    rules:
      - condition: Research results adequately answer the original request
        next: COMPLETE
      - condition: Research results are insufficient and replanning is needed
        next: plan
