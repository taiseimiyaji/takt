# Research Workflow
# A workflow that autonomously executes research tasks
# Planner creates the plan, Digger executes, Supervisor verifies
#
# Flow:
# plan -> dig -> supervise -> COMPLETE (approved)
#                          -> plan (rejected: restart from planning)

      ## Supervisor Feedback (for re-planning)
      {previous_response}

      ## Additional User Inputs
      {user_inputs}

      ## Instructions
      Create a research plan for the above request.

      **Important**: Do not ask the user questions.
      - Make assumptions for unclear points and proceed
      - If multiple interpretations exist, include all in the research scope
      - If there is feedback from Supervisor, incorporate it into the plan

      {previous_response}

      ## Additional User Inputs
      {user_inputs}

      ## Instructions
      Execute the research according to the plan above.

      **Important**: Do not ask the user questions.
      - Research within the scope of what can be investigated
      - Report items that could not be researched as "Unable to research"

      Available tools:
      - Web search
      - GitHub search (gh command)
      - Codebase search
      - File reading

      ## Judgment Criteria

      | Situation | Judgment |
      |-----------|----------|
      | Research results sufficient | APPROVE |
      | Research results insufficient | REJECT |

      ## Output Format

      | Situation | Tag |
      |-----------|-----|
      | Research complete, results sufficient | `[SUPERVISOR:APPROVE]` |
      | Insufficient, restart from planning | `[SUPERVISOR:REJECT]` |

      ### Output Examples

      **APPROVE case:**
      ```
      [SUPERVISOR:APPROVE]

      Research results adequately answer the original request.
      ```

      **REJECT case:**
      ```
      [SUPERVISOR:REJECT]

      Missing:
      - {Specific missing items}
      ```

      ## Original Research Request
      {task}

      ## Digger's Research Results
      {previous_response}

      ## Instructions
      Evaluate the research results and determine if they adequately answer the original request.

      **Important**: If there are issues, include specific instructions for the Planner.
