# Simple TAKT Workflow
# Plan -> Coder -> Architect Review -> AI Review -> Supervisor Approval
# (Simplified version of default - removed improve, fix, ai_fix, security_review, security_fix)
#
# Template Variables:
#   {iteration}      - Workflow-wide turn count (total steps executed across all agents)
#   {max_iterations} - Maximum iterations allowed for the workflow
#   {step_iteration} - Per-step iteration count (how many times THIS step has been executed)
#   {task}           - Original user request
#   {previous_response} - Output from the previous step
#   {git_diff}       - Current uncommitted changes (git diff)
#   {user_inputs}    - Accumulated user inputs during workflow
#   {report_dir}     - Report directory name (e.g., "20250126-143052-task-summary")

      ## Workflow Context
      - Iteration: {iteration}/{max_iterations} (workflow-wide)
      - Step Iteration: {step_iteration} (times this step has run)
      - Step: plan (Task Analysis)
      - Report Directory: .takt/reports/{report_dir}/
      - Report File: .takt/reports/{report_dir}/00-plan.md

      ## User Request
      {task}

      ## Previous Response (when returned from implement)
      {previous_response}

      ## Instructions
      Analyze the task and create an implementation plan.

      **Note:** If returned from implement step (Previous Response exists),
      review and revise the plan based on that feedback (replan).

      **Tasks (for implementation tasks):**
      1. Understand the requirements
      2. Identify impact scope
      3. Decide implementation approach

      **Report output:** Output to the `Report File` specified above.
      - If file does not exist: Create new file
      - If file exists: Append with `## Iteration {step_iteration}` section

      **Report format:**
      ```markdown
      # Task Plan

      ## Original Request
      {User's request as-is}

      ## Analysis Results

      ### Objective
      {What needs to be achieved}

      ### Scope
      {Impact scope}

      ### Implementation Approach
      {How to proceed}

      ## Clarifications Needed (if any)
      - {Unclear points or items requiring confirmation}

      ## Instructions
      Focus on **architecture and design** review. Do NOT review AI-specific issues (that's the next step).

      Review the changes and provide feedback.

      **Note:** In simple workflow, IMPROVE judgment is not used.
      If there are minor suggestions, use APPROVE + comments.

      ```markdown
      # Architecture Review

      ## Result: APPROVE / REJECT

      ## Summary
      {1-2 sentences summarizing result}

      ## Reviewed Perspectives
      - [x] Structure & Design
      - [x] Code Quality
