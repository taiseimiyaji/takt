Address the reviewer's feedback.
Use reports in the Report Directory shown in the Piece Context and fix the issues raised by the reviewer.
Use files in the Report Directory as primary evidence. If additional context is needed, you may consult Previous Response and conversation history as secondary sources (Previous Response may be unavailable). If information conflicts, prioritize reports in the Report Directory and actual file contents.

**Important**: After fixing, run both build and tests.
- Build verification is mandatory. Run the build (type check) and verify there are no type errors
- Running tests is mandatory. After build succeeds, always run tests and verify results
